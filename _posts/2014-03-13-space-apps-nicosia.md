Hey Space Appers,

if this [video](https://vimeo.com/82727889) brings back great memories, then you can't miss **<a href="https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/location/nicosia/" target="_blank">Space Apps Nicosia 2014</a>!**

**Save the date! April 12-13, 2014.** We will be joining over 100 cities around the world, to collaborate and solve challenges facing humanity -- both on and off Planet Earth.


Space Apps Nicosia 2014 will be **an open event organized by the community, for the community**. We stay faithful to last year's goals:

*	**bring together** people who are interested in space science, engineering, technology and art
*	promote **collaboration**
*	disseminate the mindset of **openness**

Nevertheless, we now are ready to kick-start the national space exploration program and educate the next generation of researchers and space doers.


All in all, we are trying hard to turn this **hackathon** into an unforgettable experience and help participants take the most out of it and come up with **unique, innovative solutions**.

Preparations are in full swing. Expect soon a call for **volunteers**, both for the groundwork of the event as well for the weekend.

Hold on to your hats, it's going to be a long ride upwards!

Ad astra,
