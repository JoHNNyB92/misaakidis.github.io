Salutations fellow Space geeks,

Space Apps 2014 challenges have been announced! You can find them <a href="https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge" target="_blank">here</a>. There are five themes, **Technology in Space, Human Spaceflight, Asteroids, Earth Watch, Robotics**. Choose the one that suits best your skills and inspires you the most.

Last year, participants in <a href="https://2013.spaceappschallenge.org/location/limassol/" target="_blank">Space Apps Challenge Limassol</a> proposed **16 solutions**, standing second only to London and Rome in Europe. The selected projects <a href="https://2013.spaceappschallenge.org/project/mars-sense/" target="_blank">Mars Sense</a> and <a href="https://2013.spaceappschallenge.org/project/enermap/" target="_blank">Enermap</a> received global recognition and proved what we are capable of doing in Cyprus.

Remember, Space Apps is a lot more than a weekend hackathon. Apollo 11 was not a one-man mission. On the contrary, it was a joint effort of some of the best scientists and engineers of that time, which was shared with the whole world. Take that small step and **open up** your idea, find people to **work together** and **share** your findings and hard work; this is the way to have a greater impact!

Believe in this dream and spread the word,  
to infinity... and beyond!

P.S. Today is going to be a very special day for our understanding of the fabrics of the Universe. Researchers have just announced that **Big Bang Gravity Waves** might have been detected, confirming Einstein's last untested prediction.
