WebIDE replaces the App Manager.
It is available from edition 34 onwards (on version 33 has to be enabled in about:config devtools.webide.enabled)

It is an Integrated Development Environment focusing on Web apps.
Especially useful for Firefox OS apps.

Editing environment with features like autocompletion suggestions, inline documentation, even vim/emacs/sublime key bindings.

Enables you install various runtimes (simulators) of Firefox OS. As well as connect to other browsers, including Firefox for Android, Chrome on Android, and Safari on iOS.

Uses the Firefox Developer Tools to debug Web apps running on a simulator/browser/connected device.

All you need to get started. Same tools/key bindings you've been using before => minimal learning curve.
